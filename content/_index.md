# About

Are you tired of checking the news every 5 minutes? Are you falling ever deeper into a bottomless pit of despair? 

*The Infrequent Times* is here to help. 

Quickly check a brief summary of the news on the 1st of every month. Avoid getting stuck in a 24 hour news cycle. Do your own deeper research on topics that you need to, but don't compromise your mental health.

Every month, an AI checks Wikipedia for all events that happened and summarizes the most important ones for you in an article.
